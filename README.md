● What is the engine being used?

    ○ I am using Unreal Engine because it is one of the most popular engines used for
    making modern games, both indie and AAA, which means there’s an abundance
    of resources available for help when I run into problems.
  
● What type of game will you be making?

    ○ A multiplayer game that plays in the style of the Spies vs Mercs gamemode from
    the game Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory
    ○ Camera perspective: 3rd person for spies, 1st person for mercs
  
● What does the player get to do?

    ○ Run, climb, hide, shoot, capture/defend objectives
   
● What are the constraints?

    ○ Spies cannot use weapons; Mercs cannot climb or move as fast
    ○ Currency: time

● What are the controls?

    ○ Keyboard and Mouse
    ○ WASD movement
    ○ Command pattern used for this
  
● What will be procedurally generated?

    ○ Certain animations (hopefully)
